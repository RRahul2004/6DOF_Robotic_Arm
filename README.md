# 6DOF_Robotic_Arm
This project involves a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm controlled using a PlayStation 4 (PS4) controller. The control system is built using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) running on a laptop, which handles the interpretation of joystick inputs. The joystick data is published as ROS 2 topics and transmitted to a microcontroller—a STM32F401RE—running a micro-ROS agent. The STM32 processes these commands and actuates the robotic arm using a combination of stepper motors and servo motors. The system demonstrates a real-time, responsive control architecture for robotic manipulation, leveraging the ROS 2 communication framework to integrate high-level user input with low-level motor control across embedded and desktop platforms.
